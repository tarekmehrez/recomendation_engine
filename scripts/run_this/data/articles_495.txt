PSG make contact for Liverpool talismanThe Ligue 1 champions have approached  ’s representatives regarding a summer switch but are yet to speak to Liverpool. Coutinho, 23, still has four years to run on his existing   deal but has been heavily linked with an Anfield exit throughout the last 12 months. Of players to have scored at least 10 goals in the last two seasons in Europe’s top five leagues, only Hakan Calhanoglu (5.7%) has a worse conversion rate than Coutinho (6.1%).
