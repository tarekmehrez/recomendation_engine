Rooney acknowledges England must improve at EurosWayne Rooney accepts England will have to improve at the European Championship after aÂ  lacklustre 1-0 victory against 10-man Portugal at Wembley.Rooney started in attack with Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy, but Roy Hodgson’s side lacked a cutting edge in their final warm-up match for France and needed Chris Smalling’s late goal to secure a third victory in as many games.âWe won the game, but it was always difficult for us when Portugal went down to 10 men,â Rooney, who played alongside Kane and Vardy for the first time, told ITV Sport.âThey made it difficult, but we kept going and we got the win so that was obviously important to us.âWe know in these games there have been a lot of changes. We havenât been at our best, but we have won the three games which is important especially as a young team.âWe are winning games when we are not playing well. We have to improve and in tournament football you have to improve to win games.âBruno Alves was sent off in the first half for a dangerous challenge on Kane. And Rooney, who will lead England in France later this month, added: âWe were the better team, even with 11 v 11, but we need to player better.“We know that, but it is a good sign when you don’t play as well as you can do, but you win the game.”All eyes were on the United captain, and the two top scorers in the Barclays Premier League Kane and Vardy.But the trio flattered to deceive and Hodgson will be left with a headache over whether to unleash the trio in Englandâs opening match against Russia on June 12.“We didn’t have many chances, none of us, so it is something the manager is working on and Portugal made it difficult,” Rooney added.“It is a 23-man squad, not three players. It is about all of us, not three of us.”
