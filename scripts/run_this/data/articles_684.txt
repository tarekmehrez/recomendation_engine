De Gea welcomes Mourinho: ‘We can make a great team’David De Gea has made it clear that he sees his future at Manchester United with âwinnerâ Jose Mourinho.Fresh reports in Spain on Friday suggested that Real Madrid were keen to rush through the signing of De Gea, but the goalkeeper insists that his future lies at Old Trafford.He is clearly angry at suggestions that he is trying to engineer a move despite recently signing a long-term contract.He told Marca: “Talk about Jose Mourinho and you’re talking about a winner. Winning is United’s, Jose’s and my philosophy. We can make a great team and I welcome him.âIâve got three more years on my contract with United and the desire to win more titles here.“When it comes to United, if you don’t win everything, it’s not good enough. This FA Cup is important for the club, it’s important for the fans, and it’s an important step towards winning major titles again.“People talk a lot and they know little. I know how all this works, but what I think is disrespectful is when people start making out that it’s something I have said.”
