Mitrovic happy at Newcastle but pleased by Sporting linkAleksandar Mitrovic says he is “happy” at Newcastle but also pleased to have been linked with a summer transfer to Sporting Lisbon.Mitrovic only joined Newcastle last July in a ÂŁ13million move from Anderlecht, but the 21-year-old is among the players most expected to attract interest following the Magpiesâ relegation from the Premier League.According to Portguese publication Record, Sporting have targeted the 21-year-old as a possible replacement for Islam Slimani, who is expected to leave the club this summer and has been linked with several English clubs.Mitrovic has welcomed the speculation but has hinted he will not attempt to force a St Jamesâ exit.“I have four more years of [my] contract with Newcastle and I haven’t received any official approach so far,” Mitrovic is quoted as telling Record.“I’m happy in England, of course, but it’s always good to see my name linked to a club like Sporting – it’s a big club.âIf something comes up they will always have to talk with Newcastle first, and only then with me and with my representative.â
