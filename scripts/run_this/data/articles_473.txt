Everton in talks for Dutch managerThe Toffees have been on the search for a new manager since sacking Roberto Martinez in May and have been linked with a raft of managers since. Koeman’s national compatriot Frank de Boer was a frontrunner for the job but it now appears the Southampton boss is on course to land the hot seat and will reportedly be handed a huge transfer budget by  ’s new owners. The 53-year-old still has a year remaining on his   contract and has previously insisted his intentions to see out his deal at St. Mary’s before evaluating his future. Koeman has won 36 of his 76 league matches as Southampton manager since being appointed in 2014 (47.4%).
