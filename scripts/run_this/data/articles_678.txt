Basel expect to lose Tottenham target this summerTottenham target Breel Embolo is likely toÂ Basel this summer, according to the clubâs sporting director Georg Heitz.Embolo is reported to have risen up Mauricio Pochettinoâs list of transfer targets, but Spurs could face competition from a host of Bundesliga clubs for the Switzerland starlet.“It’s very probable that he’ll leave this summer,” said Heitz.“He’s played for three seasons in our first team and he’s just 19 years old.âAt some point we have to accept that we cannot change our league. The players love our club but realise they have to change their league at some point to develop.âThere are only two countries he could go to: England or Germany.“I’d recommend him not to make too big a step. He’s intelligent enough to know he needs to go to a place where the coach gives him a chance.”Embolo has been dubbed Switzerland’s biggest prospect since Xherdan Shaqiri. He scored 13 goals in 36 appearances for Basel this season and is in the Switzerland squad for the European Championship.
