PSG poised for talks with SimeoneBlanc only signed a new two-year contact extension in February but their limp showing in the Champions League quarter-finals has left the Frenchman on the verge of being sacked by the Ligue 1 champions.  previously sounded out Simeone before he signed a contract extension in March last year that kept him bound to Atletico until 2020 but the Argentine has hinted he could leave the Spanish giants this summer after they were beaten in the Champions League final by Real Madrid for the second time in three years. Since being made   manager in 2011, Simeone has won 61.6% of his league games in charge and led the Rojiblancos to their first league title in 28 years, as well as two Champions League finals and triumph in the Copa del Rey.
