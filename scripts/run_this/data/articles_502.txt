Sunderland bid £11m for West Ham striker, 26, has spent the last two years at West Ham but could find first-team opportunities hard to come by next season with Slaven Bilic on the market for a world-class striker this summer. The Senegal international has struggled with injuries and off-field problems since arriving in the Premier League but is now a target for Sam Allardyce, who is already looking to bolster his offensive options after they were heavily dependant on Jermain Defoe’s goals last season. Despite his struggles for consistency no   player has scored more goals in the Premier League since the start of last season than Sakho (15).
