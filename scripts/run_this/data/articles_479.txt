Germany international regrets failed Juventus moveDraxler, 22, had looked set to join Juventus throughout last summer but the Serie A champions failed to match Schalke’s valuation and were beaten to his signature by Wolfsburg in a £22.5m deal. The Germany international struggled with a series of niggling injuries last season and was unequivocal in his disappointment about the collapsed move to Juventus. “It was an honour for me that Juventus wanted me and tried so hard to sign me. I have always followed them closely,” Draxler told  , via  . “I had agreed terms with Juventus, but both clubs could not agree a deal. In the end Wolfsburg wanted me to replace Kevin de Bruyne. But I would have been a Juventus player had negotiations gone quicker. “I kept a close eye on Juventus this season. It looked like I had avoided a banana skin by October, but in the end it would have been nice to win the Scudetto and Coppa Italia with Juventus. It would have been great to have played for such a strong team and with players with [Paul] Pogba and [Paulo] Dybala.” Despite his struggles for form and fitness, Draxler still managed to play a direct hand in 10 league goals from 21 appearances for Wolfsburg last season (five goals, five assists).
