West Ham target open to leaving Milan, says agentSlaven Bilic’s side have earmarked signing a world-class striker their number one priority this summer and have been linked with the likes of Michy Batshuayi, Alexandre Lacazette and Christian Benteke as a result. However, they have already been turned down by some of those targets after missing out on Champions League football last season but could turn their full attentions to Bacca, who enjoyed a successful season for   last season despite their struggles. The   have reportedly already had a £15m bid turned down for the Colombia international this week but could return with an improved offer after his agent revealed he would be open to leaving the club this summer. “There was an offer last week from West Ham which was rejected so we must wait,” Sergio Barila told  . “Carlos is very happy in Milan because it is a very big club and he has enjoyed his time there so far. “But they will not play in European competition next season and that could be a problem. At the moment Carlos is training with the national team for the Copa America and it is likely we will have to wait for the new investors before anything can develop.” Only Gonzalo Higuain (36) and Paulo Dybala (19) scored more goals than   in Serie A last season (18).
