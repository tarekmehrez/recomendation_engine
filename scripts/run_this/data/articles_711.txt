PSG target Arnautovic reveals Champions League ambitionMarko Arnautovicâs Stoke future could be in further doubt after he revealed he has his sights set on a return to Champions League football.Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes confirmed the 27-year-old does have minimum fee release clause – reported to be set at £12.5m – inserted into his current contract, which has just 12 months left to run.Arnautovic is on international duty with Austria at Euro 2016 and he is likely to be closely monitored by a number of elite European clubs, including PSG, after an excellent season with the Potters. The forward played in the Champions League with Werder Bremen before making the switch to the bet365 Stadium and is clearly wanting another taste of the top European club competition.âI hope of course it [playing in the Champions League] will happen again,â he told the Stoke Sentinel.âEvery footballer wants to play in the Champions League because it is the best there is, itâs that simple.“I hope I will succeed in the near future.”Stoke have struggled in their attempts to commit Arnautovic to a new contract and his exit would be a huge blow to Mark Hughes and his Stoke squad as he attempts to improve on last seasonâs ninth-place finish and push for a place in Europe themselves.
