Liverpool plot raid on relegated VillaAmavi, 22, made a promising start to life in the Premier League last season before he dislocated his knee while on duty with the France Under-21s back in November. The former Nice left-back has even returned to training yet but that hasnâ€™t stopped Liverpool from making an approach for his services, while the likes of AC Milan and Lyon are also interested. Amavi was named the WhoScored Man of the Match in three of his 10 league appearances for Villa, which no teammate managed to surpass throughout the rest of the season.
